  | weird attempt at making a custom animation or  |
  | maybe even a framework/game engine. Will see.  |
  \________________________________________________/


Note:
We are here to make the world think about itself...
Are things always as they seem...can I use custom things
to achieve something people have been doing for year now
without a real problem....just make it harder by going to
root and write it all like you know what you're doing.

Question everything until you understand why the decision
was the harder way....why the harder way makes better 
solutions to problems that are or haven't yet happen. 

Good luck & Have fun to all!

Some Actuall notes and usefull staff for running and 
customizing of the project.
